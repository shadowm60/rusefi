/**
 * The following obscurantism is a hack to reduce stack usage, maybe even a questionable performance
 * optimization.
 * 
 * Of note is that interrupts are NOT serviced on the stack of the thread that was running when the
 * interrupt occurred. The only thing that happens on that thread's stack is that its registers are
 * pushed (by hardware) when an interrupt occurs, just before swapping the stack pointer out for the
 * main stack (currently 0x400=1024 bytes), where the ISR actually runs.
 * see also __main_stack_size__
 * see also __process_stack_size__
 * 
 * see also http://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=chibios:kb:stacks
 *
 * In the firmware we are using 'extern *Engine' - in the firmware Engine is a signleton
 *
 * On the other hand, in order to have a meaningful unit test we are passing Engine * engine as a parameter
